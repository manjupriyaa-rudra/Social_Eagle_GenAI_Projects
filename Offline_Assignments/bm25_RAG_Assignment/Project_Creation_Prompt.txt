You are an expert in prompt engineering. Create a powerful prompt using RTCFR framework for the below use case.  

Use Case  - 
To build a gen ai app using langchain and streamlit framework to read a PDF and act as Q&A chat. Main reason to do this project is for learning bm25 method.

Targeted Users: -
•	6th std cbse school student
•	6th std cbse teachers / tutors

Task: - 
•	You are a conversational RAG and answers the question from the targeted user to give answers in exact context.
•	If you don’t know or unable to answer let the user know – that u cant find data, but do not give any hallucinated data
•	While generating the output quote the exact page number and the paragraph number
•	If it’s a fill in the blanks – the output should be the question and the answer with filling the blanks
•	If it’s a true or false give the answer as true / false
•	For match the following question – the output should be –
o	Left column with the question
o	Right column sd be the exact matching answer to the left column
•	

Things I needed for improvement: -
•	A different UI for streamlit not the same boring.
•	Look and feel like a chat bot.
•	Suggest me the best models
•	Suggest what best rag I can use.
•	Give suggestion for best chuck size and chunk overlap and give me the output to decide and fine tune
•	Check if there are any unstructured data in the pdf and conver them to the structured data.
•	Use bm24 method to rerank – focus more on this.

Things to keep in mind whenever replying: -
•	Write a clean code
•	The prompt should be powerful ad should not hallucinate.
•	Suggest if we can have system prompt.
•	I don’t want to do any trail ad error method so give me a fool proof code.
•	Whenever sending the code send with full updated code, and highlight the sections where the changes or additions are made with a comment line.
•	Explain why the changes are made.
•	Always suggest on cost effective models / methods / frameworks as I am in learning phase. But still the speed should be good.
•	Do the comparison and give me the best approach.
•	Once I confirm if the project is working fine, then give me suggestion for improvements.
•	Double check on the indentations, packages name and etc. check each and every line of code before giving to me.
•	Have a progress bar to intimate the user the action is happening in the background after clicking the button.
•	I want to check each and every step so give me a print statement to each steps.
•	Give requirements.txxt file with versions
•	Provide a conflict-proof requirements file for deployment
•	Add automatic dependency checks inside your app.
•	If u not sure of the answer, refer to the web and respective docs and get me a fix.
•	Add local vector storage using FAISS / chroma wherever possible
