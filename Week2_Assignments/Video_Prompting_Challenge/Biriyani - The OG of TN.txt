🎬 1-Minute Anime Biriyani Storyboard with transition

🎬 OPENING SCENE - 1 : PROMPT — MORNING BEGINS
-----------------------------------------------
Here is how the scene unfolds.
Early morning sunrise over a semi-urban South Indian neighborhood, viewed from a top-angle aerial perspective. Modest houses with tiled roofs, small trees, narrow streets, and quiet courtyards create a peaceful family setting. Golden sun rays spread across rooftops as soft mist lingers in the air.
Birds fly gently across the frame while a few birds perch and chirp on electric wires. Camera remains smooth and slow, slightly drifting forward from above.
Lighting is very warm and shiny sunrise sunlight, soft shadows, natural glow. Emotional tone is calm, hopeful, and comforting — the feeling of a new day beginning for a normal family.
Style is cinematic anime realism with subtle film grain, high detail, soft atmospheric haze, shallow depth of field in distant background, clean composition.
Aspect ratio 16:9.
Pacing is slow and premium.
Constraints: no people visible, no vehicles moving, no modern high-rise buildings, no clutter, no neon colors, no dramatic clouds.
End the shot with sunlight filling the frame, preparing for smooth transition into kitchen scene.

🎬 TITLE / END CARD — SCENE 6 - FINAL PROMPT
________________________________________
Here is how the scene unfolds.
A premium advertisement end frame in 16:9 aspect ratio. Background is the same traditional South Indian kitchen setup as the reference image: clay stove with gentle glowing fire, brass vessels on wooden shelves, soft sunlight entering through window, warm cinematic ambience — no people present, empty kitchen, peaceful and minimal.
Centered perfectly both horizontally and vertically appears the word “Biriyani” in bold, elegant gold typography — refined, authoritative, luxury mass-brand aesthetic. Generous negative space surrounds the title. Subtle vignette toward frame edges.
Beneath it, in smaller balanced gold lettering, the subtitle fades in smoothly:
“Every Sunday is not complete without Biriyani”
A soft golden light sweep passes horizontally across the main “Biriyani” text, creating a gentle highlight (no glare). Subtle fire crackles from the clay stove in the background, barely visible, adding warmth without distraction.
After a brief pause, a third line appears below with a soft fade-in and slight pop-out animation:
“Today is very special we are completing it with a video for prompt battle”
Background remains matte, cinematic, and uncluttered. Premium textile-inspired texture, soft film grain, high contrast, sharp crisp typography, no motion blur. Clean composition suitable for television and digital advertising.
Emotional tone: warm, family-oriented, celebratory.
Camera remains static.
Lighting stays soft and golden throughout.
End with gentle fade to black.
Style: cinematic branding still, luxury mass appeal, ultra clean, ultra detailed.
Constraints / Negative prompt:
no characters, no people, no extra text, no watermark, no logos other than brand name, no clutter, no overpowering gradients, no neon glow.
